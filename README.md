Seeking beauty while striving to understand the complexities of the world.  

Since 2014, my journey has intertwined product design and brand identity in crypto. With Bitcoin, I discovered an opportunity to work fostering an open economic system based on freedom and responsibility.

I've collaborated with projects like [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com/), [Flashbots](https://flashbots.net/), [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/), [ETHLatam](http://ethlatam.org/), [Ethernaut DAO](https://mint.ethernautdao.io/#about) and [Rewilder](https://rewilder.xyz/).

I also enjoy bringing my designs to life through coding. I have experience in frontend development, including HTML, CSS, React, and Svelte.

Beyond my professional pursuits, I am interested in anthropology, biology, behavioral science, color theory, architecture, scenography, and pottery. I'm part of the Fuego Austral community, bringing art to life and cultivating meaningful offline connections. 

I invite you to email me at hey@deadpine.xyz and discuss shared interests or potential collaborations :)
