#### Seeking beauty while striving to understand the complexities of the world.  

For 10 years my journey intertwined product design and brand identity with technology, mostly in crypto. With Bitcoin and Ethereum I discovered an opportunity to work fostering an open economic system based on freedom and responsibility.

I've collaborated with projects like [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com/), [Flashbots](https://flashbots.net/), [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/), [ETHLatam](http://ethlatam.org/), 
[Forta](https://forta.org/), [Exactly](https://x.com/deadpine_xyz/status/1631379467909079061), [Ethernaut DAO](https://mint.ethernautdao.io/#about) and [Rewilder](https://rewilder.xyz/).

I also enjoy bringing my designs to life through coding. I have experience in frontend development, including HTML, CSS, React, and Svelte.

However, not everything is about technology.

Beyond my professional pursuits, I am interested in biology, anthropology, behavioral science, color theory, architecture, scenography, and ceramics. I'm part of the Fuego Austral community, bringing art to life and cultivating meaningful offline connections.

I invite you to email me at hey@deadpine.xyz and discuss shared interests or potential collaborations :)
