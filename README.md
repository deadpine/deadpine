Human seeking beauty while striving to understand the complexities of the world.  
(Also working on product design and brand identity)

Since 2014, my journey has been intertwined with design and crypto-economics. While studying design in Buenos Aires, I discovered Bitcoin and developed a deep devotion to fostering an open economic system based on freedom and responsibility.

I've had the privilege of collaborating as a designer with projects like [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com/), [Flashbots](https://flashbots.net/), [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/), [ETHLatam](http://ethlatam.org/),  [Rewilder]([https://app.rewilder.xyz/#](https://app.rewilder.xyz/donation/1)) and [Ethernaut DAO](https://mint.ethernautdao.io/#about), and I continue to do so.

In addition to my design background, I have experience in frontend development, including HTML, CSS, React, and Svelte. I enjoy bringing my designs to life through coding.
