Human seeking beauty while striving to understand the complexities of the world.
(Also working on product design and brand identity)

Since 2017, I've been involved in the crypto space. I was the lead designer at [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com/) and worked with projects like [Flashbots](https://flashbots.net/), [ETHLatam](http://ethlatam.org/), [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/), [Rewilder]([https://app.rewilder.xyz/#](https://app.rewilder.xyz/donation/1)) and [Ethernaut DAO](https://mint.ethernautdao.io/#about).
Aside from a background in design, I have experience in frontend, HTML, CSS, React, and Svelte.
