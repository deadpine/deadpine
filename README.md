## Hello world

I’m a graphic designer specialized in product, UI and branding.

Since 2017 I’ve been working in the crypto space. I was the lead designer at [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com/) and worked with projects like [Flashbots](https://flashbots.net/), [ETHLatam](http://ethlatam.org/), [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/), [Rewilder](https://app.rewilder.xyz/#) and [Ethernaut DAO](https://mint.ethernautdao.io/#about).

Aside from a background in UI and branding I have experience in frontend, HTML, CSS, React and Svelte.

Nowadays I am working as a freelancer and open for new projects.
